                    <h3>Importance of Homeschooling Associations...</h3>
                    <p>Government generally engages with the public is through representative organisations, such as associations. Only when proposed policy or law is published for public comment does government consider inputs from individuals. An association is an organisation where members of a specific interest group elect an executive committee during an annual general meeting. This committee can then engage with government or the media to represent its members. <a href="concerns-of-the-home-education-movement.html" title="Click visit">Click here</a> for more information on why associations are important and how you can establish one.</p>

                    <h3>Put pressure on government to listen...</h3>
                    <p>Homeschool Associations and the Pestalozzi Trust occasionally request homeschooling parents to write letters to government or sign petitions, in order to put pressure on government to listen to the objections of the public. Because government is legally obliged to consider each letter received as part of a public participation process, a letter writing campaign can cause significant delays in the legislative process. It was thanks to the hundreds of letters from home educators that the introduction of BELA Bill could not be handled by the fifth parliament. It will have to be handled by the sixth parliament, which might look totally different. However, even if government ignores the letters from the public, this can be used at a later stage in court to provide evidence that a public participation process followed in a legislative process was flawed.</p>

                    <h3>Prepares for engaging with government...</h3>
                    <p>The home education movement is very diverse, a large diversity of views on how home education should be practiced and regulated. Something that is perfectly reasonable to one might be an infringement of a fundamental human right to another or against the religious convictions of another and can cause conflict between families and the state in the future. It is important that the home education movement <strong>prepares for engaging with government on the BELA Bill in a unified and well considered manner</strong>. If this is not done, government might choose to only engage with those that are closest aligned to the ideology of the state, and draft law that infringes on the rights of many members of the movement, whilst claiming that they consulted with the movement.</p>

                    <p>When BELA Bill is submitted by parliament the members of parliament (MP's) will vote on this bill. Home educators can approach MP's through the constituency offices and explain to them how home education works and what the negative effects of BELA Bill will be. This might make MP's less inclined to support BELA Bill. <a href="Constituency-Office.html" title="Click to visit">Click here</a> for an article that explains how to approach MP's through the constituency offices.</p>

                                <p>he home education movement emphasises the need for extensive consultation due to the diverse and distributed nature of the movement. If government actually takes cognisance of this, parliament might decide to have public hearings all over the country, as they did for the Expropriation Without Compensation constitutional amendment proposal. If this is the case, there might be as much as 3 public hearings in each province. Without provincial associations, there will be many public hearings without submissions on home education, due to the limited capacity of national organisations.</p>

                                <p>South Africa’s electoral system is one of proportional representation, meaning that MPs and MPLs are not elected from geographical areas in the way that ward councillors are in local government elected. This does not mean that representatives are not expected to interact with the public. Parliament makes available to each party represented in Parliament a 'Political Party Constituency Allowance' and political parties must use these funds to operate constituency offices. These are about 350 Constituency Offices around the country where members of the public can approach elected representatives.</p>
